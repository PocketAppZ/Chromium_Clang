# Chromium_Clang

The Chromium web browser for Windows built with the open source Clang compiler and LLD linker.

Additional features of the build include modified compiler optimizations, including whole-program analysis and cross-module optimization using "thin" link time optimization (ThinLTO), via build configuration modifications.

Builds marked with the "+npm" tag utilize the LLVM "new pass manager" for building.

Implementation of various options are subject to change depending upon performance, stability, and similar paramaters.
