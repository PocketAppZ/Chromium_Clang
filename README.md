# Chromium_Clang

The Chromium web browser for Windows built with the open source Clang compiler and LLD linker.

The 64-bit builds starting at r499551 now feature whole-program analysis, cross-module optimization, and "full_wpo_on_official" building using ThinLTO link time optimization via build configuration modifications.
